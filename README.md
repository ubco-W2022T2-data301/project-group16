## Our Dataset

[The Global Cost of Living dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mvieira101/global-cost-of-living) was retrieved from Kaggle and originally sourced from Numbeo, a Serbian crowd-sourced global database of various statistics including consumer prices. This particular dataset includes the cost of living data on well over 4500 cities across the world.

The purpose of this dataset is to provide the public with crowd-sourced data to estimate the cost of living in different cities around the world. With over 50 variables that range from the cost of a McDonald's meal to a pair of Levi's jeans, this dataset can serve both individuals and select businesses that wish to compare the relative affordability of a specific location.

The data was gathered by scraping Numbeo's website and according to the description on Kaggle, it includes updated values as of December 3rd, 2022. Although the data is crowd-sourced, it still includes valuable information that serves as a rough estimate of the cost of living across various locations.

Altogether, this dataset from Numbeo's crowd-sourced website brings over 50 variables of consumer goods, services and other metrics such as personal monthly income from over 4500 cities worldwide. This dataset is certain to provide valuable insight into what makes it: an expensive reality.
