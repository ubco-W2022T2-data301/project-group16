    "## Research questions/interests\n",
    "I am primarily interested in what I consider to be the \"necessities\" when it comes to the cost of living, meaning I will not be analyzing any \"luxury items\" that are present in this data set such as leisure activities, clothing or private school.\n",
    "\n",
    "### My Primary Question:\n",
    "1. **How liveable is it in Kelowna compared to other cities globally? How does the cost of necessities, such as food items, transportation, and shelter vary across different cities as compared to Kelowna, serving as the baseline?**\n",
    " \n",
    " > To successfully answer this question the cost of these necessities will be compared to the average monthly net salary in each location. New columns will be made that serve as a \"necessities index\" that will include a food index, rent index and transportation index. Since Kelowna will serve as the baseline its index will be set at 100 and any index that is higher or lower will represent a % change when being compared to Kelowna.\n",

    "### Supporting Questions Regarding Necessities and Cost of Living:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Can the price of a Mcdonald's meal tell us anything about the cost of living in a country?**\n",
    " \n",
    " > I wish to recreate the \"Big Mac Index\" by aggregating column \"x3\", McMeal at Mcdonalds or Equivalent Combo Meal, by country. Then I will compare that index to various \"necessities index\" such as the ones described in question 1 to determine how accurate of an indicator the price of a Mcdonald's meal reveals the cost of living by country. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Do the prices of gas and public transport have any relationship to the overall cost of living across different countries and how does this relationship impact job opportunities?**\n",
    "\n",
    " > The goal of this question is to see if the cost of gas itself or public transport has any impact on a country's cost of living. More specifically, do people earn more when their ability to transport themselves is cheaper? How are other necessities (food/shelter) impacted when the price of gas/transport is more expensive? Here, I will use columns such as income, housing costs, and food expenses to examine the relationship between transportation costs and the overall cost of living by country. \n",
