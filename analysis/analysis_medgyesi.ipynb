    "### My Primary Question:\n",

    "1. **How does the affordability of housing in Kelowna vary relative to the average monthly net salary, and what factors such as population density, location and demand may be driving or affecting these discrepancies.**\n",
    "\n",
    "> To answer this question, I am going to analyze the data on the average monthly net saraly and the cost of apartments in various canadian locations. I will then calculate the average cost of housing as a percentage of the varegae salary in each location. I will also focus on the considerable changes in the affordability of housing in Kelowna. I will also explore the potential factors that possibly contribute to these differences.\n",

    "2. **Is there a correlation between the price of housing and the cost of living and is it impacted by outside factors such as groceries, transportation, and gasoline prices?**\n",
    " \n",
    " > To answer this question, we will need to find if there is a correlation between the price of housing and the cost of living. We can use regression to examine the relationships between housing prcies and the multiple factors listed. By anaylyzing this way, we will be able to determine if there is any relationship bonded from these categories. If so, we will determine which factor has the greatest impact on the price of housing. \n",

By examining this data over different intervals of time, I will find if there are any significant changes or fluxuations in the housing market.\n",
